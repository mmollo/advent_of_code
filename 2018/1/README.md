# Day 1

## Part A

It was pretty easy, even if I'm not satisfied with the performances.
The whole input has to be read multiple times and I think I can find something better with Stream module.

## Part B

Kinda frustrating. I was unable to find a solution at first.
I'm so used to think in classic loops that the recursion is hard to grasp.
I did a first solution in PHP, pretty easy and fast.
I tried the same algorithm in Elixir, using recursion.
The good thing is that I'm now able to think in recursion functions instead of loops.
The bad thing, Elixir solution is quite slow while PHP is almost instant,
but I suspect there's some overhead when starting an Erlang node.
