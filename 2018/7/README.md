# Day 7

## Part A

I'm very bad with trees, but this was really fun. The hardest part was to assume
there was only one root node, which is obviously not the case with the full input.

## Part B

I'm not sure that's optimal, but i'm pretty proud of this simulation. A working pool
and a job distributor!
