# Day 5

## Part A
Very interesting problem. My first solution was extremely slow and was
parsing the input multiple time. The second implementation only scan the
input once.

## Part B
Quite easy, it's only a comparison of various runs of the part A.
The first solution I used took around 25 minutes to finish. This one only
took 5 seconds.
