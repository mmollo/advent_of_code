# Day 2

## Part A

What a mess, this first implementation is a mess. I'll try to bring a cleaner solution tomorrow.

## Part B

Very easy with the PHP function Levenshtein, I need to find an equivalent in Elixir, or something close.
I think it could be good way to test comprehensions, but my implementation is not efficient.
Well...it works, but it's ugly and slow. Shame.
