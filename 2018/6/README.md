# Day 6

## Part A

Very intersting. I had to actually generate an image to visualize the areas. The hardest part
was to indentify infinite ones. I count as infinite any area that crosses the boundaries.
Boundaries are defined by the coordinates of the four most "extremes" points.

## Part B

Actually faster and easier than part A. Funny.
